## 📊 Project Objectives

We explore the following key research questions:

1. 📈 **Interest Level vs. Age Over Time**  
   _How does "interest level" relate to age, and how has that relationship evolved from 2020 to 2024?_

2. 🚻 **Gender & Degree Program Correlation**  
   _How does gender relate to the “degree program” category? Has that relationship shifted over the years?_

3. 🌍 **Race/Ethnicity Demographics (2020–2024)**  
   _How have the race and ethnicity demographics of survey respondents changed over time, if at all?_

4. 🎯 **Motivation vs. Degree Program**  
   _How does a student's degree program align with their motivation for pursuing the degree?_
